## Implementation Details

### Responsive Design Approach

The responsive design was implemented using:
- CSS media queries to target different screen sizes
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for flexible layouts
- Relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixel sizes
- Mobile-first approach for CSS organization

### Key Breakpoints

- Mobile: Up to 576px
- Tablet: 577px to 991px
- Desktop: 992px and above

### Mascot Implementation

The mascot was created using:
- Custom SVG code for lightweight, scalable graphics
- CSS animations for the bouncing effect
- CSS transitions for smooth hover interactions

## Code Snippets

### Responsive Media Query Example

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
  .hero-content h2 {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  
  .product-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  
  .mobile-only {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Mascot Animation

```css
.mascot {
  animation: bounce 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-15px); }
}
```
